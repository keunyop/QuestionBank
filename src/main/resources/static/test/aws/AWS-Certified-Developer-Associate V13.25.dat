By using unique cryptography C. Amazon SQS queue has a configurable visibility timeout. D. Multiple readers can't access the same message queue|^|Answer: C |^|Explanation: Every Amazon SQS queue has a configurable visibility timeout. For the designated amount of time after a message is read from a queue, it will not be visible to any other reader. As long as the amount of time that it takes to process the message is less than the visibility timeout, every message will be processed and deleted. In the event that the component processing the message fails or becomes unavailable, the message will again become visible to any component reading the queue once the visibility timeout ends. This allows you to have many components all reading messages from the same queue, with each working to process different messages. |^|Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/

NO.65|^|An organization has created multiple components of a single application for compartmentalization. Currently all the components are hosted on a single EC2 instance. Due to security reasons the organization wants to implement two separate SSLs for the separate modules although it is already using VPC. How can the organization achieve this with a single instance? |^|A. Create a VPC instance which will have both the ACL and the security group attached to it and have separate rules for each IP address. B. Create a VPC instance which will have multiple network interfaces with multiple elastic IP addresses. C. You have to launch two instances each in a separate subnet and allow VPC peering for a single IP. D. Create a VPC instance which will have multiple subnets attached to it and each will have a separate IP address. |^|Answer: B |^|Explanation: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the user has defined. With VPC the user can specify multiple private IP addresses for his instances. The number of network interfaces and private IP addresses that a user can specify for an instance depends on the instance type. With each network interface the organization can assign an EIP. This scenario helps when the user wants to host multiple websites on a single EC2 instance by using multiple SSL certificates on a single server and associating each certificate with a specific EIP address. It also helps in scenarios for operating network appliances, such as firewalls or load balancers that have multiple private IP addresses for each network interface. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html

Which AWS services would be best to use to accomplish this? |^|A. Amazon CloudFront, Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing. B. Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail. C. Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing. D. Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Elastic Beanstalk |^|Answer: C |^|Explanation: Auto Scaling enables you to follow the demand curve for your applications closely, reducing the need to manually provision Amazon EC2 capacity in advance. For example, you can set a condition to add ne w Amazon EC2 instances in increments to the Auto Scaling group when the average utilization of your Amazon EC2 fleet is high; and similarly, you can set a condition to remove instances in the same increments when CPU utilization is low. If you have predictable load changes, you can set a schedule through Auto Scaling to plan your scaling activities. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to send alarms to trigger scaling activities and Elastic Load Balancing to help distribute traffic to your instances within Auto Scaling groups. Auto Scaling enables you to run your Amazon EC2 fleet at optimal utilization. |^|Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/

NO.99|^|Which of the following solutions is not supported by DynamoDB: |^|A. Hash secondary index B. Local secondary index C. Hash Primary Key D. Global secondary index |^|Answer: A |^|Explanation: In DynamoDB, a secondary index is a data structure that contains a subset of attributes from a table, along with an alternate key to support Query operations. DynamoDB supports the following two types of secondary indexes: Local secondary index is an index that has the same hash key as the table, but a different range key. A local secondary index is "local" in the sense that every partition of a local secondary index is scoped to a table partition that has the same hash key. Global secondary index is an index with a hash and range key that can be different from those on the table. A global secondary index is considered "global" because queries on the index can span all of the data in a table, across all partitions. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DataModel.html
NO.100|^|You are building an online store on AWS that uses SQS to process your customer orders. Yourbackend system needs those messages in the same sequence the customer orders have been put in. How can you achieve that? |^|A. You can do this with SQS but you also need to use SWF B. Messages will arrive in the same order by default C. You can use sequencing information on each message D. It is not possible to do this with SQS |^|Answer: C |^|Explanation: Amazon SQS is engineered to always be available and deliver messages. One of the resulting tradeoffs is that SQS does not guarantee first in, first out delivery of messages. For many distributed applications, each message can stand on its own, and as long as all messages are delivered, the order is not important. If your system requires that order be preserved, you can place sequencing information in each message, so that you can reorder the messages when the queue returns them. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/Welcome.html
NO.101|^|An organization has enabled a strict password policy for its IAM users. The organization is taking help from the IAM console to set the password policy.

Allow at least one non-alphanumeric character D. Do not allow the user to use the password from the last three passwords |^|Answer: D |^|Explanation: AWS IAM allows an organization to create multiple users and provide them access to various AWS services. By default when the user is created, he does not have password enabled and can not login to AWS console. If the organization wants to allow the users to login to AWS console, they can enable password for each user. It is required that IAM users follow certain guidelines to set their IAM login password. For this IAM provides root account owner to setup passwrod policy. The password policy also lets the specify whether all IAM users can change their own passwords. As part of policy, organization can specify that passwords for IAM users must be of a certain minimum length, must include certain characters, and a few more criteria such as below. One upper / lower or both letters One alpha numeric One number |^|Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingPasswordPolicies.html

NO.114|^|An organization has launched two applications: one for blogging and one for ECM on the same AWS Linux EC2 instance running in the AWS VPC. The organization has attached two private IPs (primary and secondary) to the above mentioned instance. The organization wants the instance OS to recognize the secondary IP address. How can the organization configure this? |^|A. Use the ec2-net-utility package which updates routing tables, uses DHCP to refresh the secondary IP and adds the network interface. B. Use the ec2-net-utils package which will configure an additional network interface and update the routing table C. Use the ec2-ip-update package which can configure the network interface as well as update the secondary IP with DHCP. D. Use the ec2-ip-utility package which can update the routing tables as well as refresh the secondary IP using DHCP. |^|Answer: B |^|Explanation: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. It enables the user to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that the user has defined. With VPC the user can specify multiple private IP addresses for his instances. The number of network interfaces and private IP addresses that a user can specify for an instance depends on the instance type. This scenario helps when the user wants to host multiple websites on asingle EC2 instance. After the user has assigned a secondary private IP address to his instance, he needs to configure the operating system on that instance to recognize the secondary private IP address. For AWS Linux, the ec2-net-utils package can take care of this step. It configures additional network interfaces that the user can attach while the instance is running, refreshes secondary IP addresses during DHCP lease renewal, and updates the related routing rules. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html

Launch a VPC with ELB such that it redirects requests to separate VPC instances of the public subnet. |^|Answer: C |^|Explanation: If you need to host multiple websites(with different IPs) on a single EC2 instance, the following is the suggested method from AWS. Launch a VPC instance with two network interfaces Assign elastic IPs from VPC EIP pool to those interfaces (Because, when the user has attached more than one network interface with an instance, AWS cannot assign public IPs to them.) Assign separate Security Groups if separate Security Groups are needed This scenario also helps for operating network appliances, such as firewalls or load balancers that have multiple private IP addresses for each network interface. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html
NO.184|^|A user has configured a website and launched it using the Apache web server on port 80. The user is using ELB with the EC2 instances for Load Balancing.

NO.216|^|An organization is having an application which can start and stop an EC2 instance as per schedule. The organization needs the MAC address of the instance to be registered with its software. The instance is launched in EC2-CLASSIC. How can the organization update the MAC registration every time an instance is booted? |^|A. The instance MAC address never changes. Thus, it is not required to register the MAC address every time. B. The organization should write a boot strapping script which will get the MAC address from the instance metadata and use that script to register with the application. C. AWS never provides a MAC address to an instance; instead the instance ID is used for identifying the instance for any software registration. D. The organization should provide a MAC address as a part of the user data. Thus, whenever the instance is booted the script assigns the fixed MAC address to that instance. |^|Answer: B |^|Explanation: AWS provides an on demand, scalable infrastructure. AWS EC2 allows the user to launch On-Demand instances. AWS does not provide a fixed MAC address to the instances launched in EC2-CLASSIC. If the instance is launched as a part of EC2-VPC, it can have an ENI which can have a fixed MAC. However, with EC2-CLASSIC, every time the instance is started or stopped it will have a new MAC address. To get this MAC, the organization can run a script on boot which can fetch the instance metadata and get the MAC address from that instance metadata. Once the MAC is received, the organization canregister that MAC with the software. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapterinstancedata.html

Merge all the accounts with consolidated billing B. Create the same account alias with each account ID C. It is not possible to have the same IAM account login URL for separate AWS accounts D. Create the S3 bucket with an alias name and use the redirect rule to forward requests to various accounts |^|Answer: C |^|Explanation: If a user wants the URL of the AWS IAM sign-in page to have a company name instead of the AWS account ID, he can create an alias for his AWS account ID. The alias should be unique. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AccountAlias.html
NO.218|^|A user has setup an application on EC2 which uses the IAM user access key and secret access key to make secure calls to S3. The user wants to temporarily stop the access to S3 for that IAM user. What should the root owner do? |^|A. Delete the IAM user B. Change the access key and secret access key for the users C. Disable the access keys for the IAM user D. Stop the instance |^|Answer: C |^|Explanation: If the user wants to temporarily stop the access to S3 the best solution is to disable the keys. Deleting the user will result in a loss of all the credentials and the app will not be useful in the future. If the user stops the instance IAM users can still access S3. The change of the key does not help either as they are still active. The best possible solution is to disable the keys. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingCredentials.html
NO.219|^|A user has developed an application which is required to send the data to a NoSQL database.

Which of the below mentioned applications helps in this scenario? |^|A. AWS Simple Notification Service B. AWS Simple WorkflowC. AWS Simple Query Service D. AWS Simple Queue Service |^|Answer: D |^|Explanation: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, and fully managed message queuing service. SQS provides a simple and cost-effective way to decouple the components of an application. In this case, the user can use AWS SQS to send messages which are received from an application and sent to DB. The application can continue processing data without waiting for any acknowledgement from DB. The user can use SQS to transmit any volume of data without losing messages or requiring other services to always be available. |^|Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/

Security group of EC2 allowed in the RDS security group C. Configuring the elastic IP of the instance in RDS security group D. Configure the Public IP of the instance in RDS security group |^|Answer: A |^|Explanation: If the user is going to specify an IP range in RDS security group, AWS recommends using the private IP address of the Amazon EC2 instance. This provides a more direct network route from the Amazon EC2 instance to the Amazon RDS DB instance, and does not incur network charges for the data sent outside of the Amazon network. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithSecurityGroups.htm l

NO.240|^|An ELB is diverting traffic across 5 instances. One of the instances was unhealthy only for 20 minutes. What will happen after 20 minutes when the instance becomes healthy? |^|A. ELB will never divert traffic back to the same instance B. ELB will not automatically send traffic to the same instance. However, the user can configure to start sending traffic to the same instance C. ELB starts sending traffic to the instance once it is healthy D. ELB terminates the instance once it is unhealthy. Thus, the instance cannot be healthy after 10 minutes |^|Answer: C |^|Explanation: AWS Elastic Load Balancing continuously checks the health of an instance. If one of the instances is unhealthy it stops sending traffic to it and automatically reroutes the traffic to the remaining running EC2 instances. If the failed EC2 instance is restored, Elastic Load Balancing will again start sending traffic to that instance. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/SvcIntro.html

IAM access key and secret access key B. IAM X.509 certificates C. Nothing. Everything is disabled by default D. IAM passwords |^|Answer: C |^|Explanation: Newly created IAM users have no password and no access key (access key ID and secret access key). If the user needs to administer your AWS resources using the AWS Management Console, you can create a password for the user. If the user needs to interact with AWS programmatically (using the command line interface (CLI), the AWS SDK, or service-specific APIs), you can create an access key for that user. The credentials you create for users are what they use to uniquely identify themselves to AWS. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html
NO.249|^|A user has created an EBS instance in the US-East-1a AZ. The user has a volume of 30 GB in the US-East-1b zone. How can the user attach the volume to an instance? |^|A. Since both the volume and the instance are in the same region, the user can attach the volume B. Use the volume migrate function to move the volume from one AZ to another and attach to the instance C. Take a snapshot of the volume. Create a new volume in the USEast-1a and attach that to the instance D. Use the volume replicate function to create a new volume in the US-East-1a and attach that to thevolume |^|Answer: C |^|Explanation: If an EBS volume is not in the same AZ of an EC2 instance, it cannot be attached to the instance. The only option is to take a snapshot of the volume and create a new volume in the instance's AZ. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html
NO.250|^|What happens, by default, when one of the resources in a CloudFormation stack cannot be created? |^|A. Previously-created resources are kept but the stack creation terminates. B.

NO.251|^|A user is planning to use EBS for his DB requirement. The user already has an EC2 instance running in the VPC private subnet. How can the user attach the EBS volume to a running instance? |^|A. The user must create EBS within the same VPC and then attach it to a running instance. B. The user can create EBS in the same zone as the subnet of instance and attach that EBS to instance. C. It is not possible to attach an EBS to an instance running in VPC until the instance is stopped. D. The user can specify the same subnet while creating EBS and then attach it to a running instance. |^|Answer: B |^|Explanation: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the user's AWS account. The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. The VPC is always specific to a region. The user can create a VPC which can span multiple Availability Zones by adding one or more subnets in each Availability Zone. The instance launched will always be in the same availability zone of the respective subnet. When creating an EBS the user cannot specify the subnet or VPC. However, the user must create the EBS in the same zone as the instance so that it can attach the EBS volume to the running instance. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPCSubnet
NO.252|^|In regard to DynamoDB, what is the Global secondary index? |^|A. An index with a hash and range key that can be different from those on the table. B.

The user cannot specify more than two policies for AutoScaling |^|Answer: B |^|Explanation: To configure the Auto Scaling termination policy, the user can either specify any one of the policies as a standalone policy or list multiple policies in an ordered list. The policies are executed in the order that they are listed. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/us-terminationpolicy.html
NO.254|^|How can you peek at a message in Amazon SQS? |^|A. Log the message ID and the receipt handle for your messages and correlate them to confirm when a message has been received and deleted B. Send the message to Amazon S3 C. You can't D. Set up a CloudWatch alarm to auto send you the message |^|Answer: A |^|Explanation: With version 2008-01-01, the PeekMessage action has been removed from Amazon SQS. This functionality was used mainly to debug small systems - specifically to confirm a message was successfully sent to the queue or deleted from the queue. To do this with version 2008-01-01, you can log the message ID and the receipt handle for your messages and correlate them to confirm when a message has been received and deleted. |^|Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/items/1343?externalID=1343
NO.255|^|An organization has created 10 IAM users. The organization wants those users to work independently and access AWS. Which of the below mentioned options is not a possible solution? |^|A. Create the access key and secret access key for each user and provide access to AWS using the console B. Create the X.509 certificate for each user and provide them access to AWS CLI C. Enable MFA for each IAM user and assign them the virtual MFA device to access the console D. Provide each user with the IAM login and password for the AWS console |^|Answer: A |^|Explanation: If an organization has created the IAM users, the users can access AWS services either with an IAM specific login/password or console. The organization can generate the IAM X.509 certificates to access AWS with CLI. The organization can also enable MFA for each IAM user, which allows an added security for each IAM user. If the organization has created the access key and secret key than the user cannotaccess the console using those keys. Access key and secret access key are useful for CLI or Webservices. |^|Reference: http://docs.aws.ama
